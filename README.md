# TAFE Assignment: Arithmetic Challenge Game
This was just an assignment that was submitted during my TAFE diploma course. There isn't much to it, the code is messy, however it's worth sharing.

This program is a simple network-based game where a teacher can send an equation to the student to solve, and the student can submit the answer.

It has some weird code in there to simply meet the criteria of the assignment, however some things were removed before uploading.
